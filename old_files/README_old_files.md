# old files

In this folder we have all the old files we used to prototype our code.

it can be seperated into 3 categories roughly corresponding to the weeks:

**data visualizations**

*multi_visualizer.py*
This file shows comparisons between multiple columns per category. It also shows the first visualizations of per month sales data (quite ineficiently as we were not using pandas for this). 

*normalized_histogram.py*
This file was used to normalize data to find if this gave good comparisons.

**fitting functions to data**



**clustering**

*fourier_fit.py*
This file was to experiment with fourier fits using the data from file.csv
