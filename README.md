We aim to compare the population size of fishes to environmental factors caused by human intervention and direct human interaction (fishing). To do this we look at datasets from the UN food and agriculture organization and environmental datasets.

Research questions and hypotheses
R1 Which factors impact the fish population size?
For each factor independently:
	H0: this factor has no correlation with fish population size

R2 Which fish species are more impacted by these factors?
For each correlated factor pair:
	H0: the two factors are equally important to population size

R3 Can we classify fish species into low, medium and high sensitivity groups?

R? More questions will follow from the specifics of our dataset (such as location data) and further understanding of existing models. 



Updated
We aim to analyze the possible factors determining consumer average spending amount, such as gender, geographical location, product type, payment method, discount or promotion, etc. We gathered shopping trend datasets to make further prediction.

Research Question and Hypotheses
R1 Which factors influence the consumer average spending amount?
	For each factor independently:
 	H0: this factor has a significant effect on consumer average spending amount.

Potential factors:
a. Demographics: age, gender (categorical), income level (continuous)
b. Geographic: country/regions (categorical)
c. Individual shopping behavior: product type (categorical), payment method (categorical)
d. External: Discount (binary: Yes=1, No=0), holiday season (binary: Yes=1, No=0)
