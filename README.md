We aim to compare the population size of fishes to environmental factors caused by human intervention and direct human interaction (fishing). To do this we look at datasets from the UN food and agriculture organization and environmental datasets.

Research questions and hypotheses
R1 Which factors impact the fish population size?
For each factor independently:
	H0: this factor has no correlation with fish population size

R2 Which fish species are more impacted by these factors?
For each correlated factor pair:
	H0: the two factors are equally important to population size

R3 Can we classify fish species into low, medium and high sensitivity groups?

R? More questions will follow from the specifics of our dataset (such as location data) and further understanding of existing models.
