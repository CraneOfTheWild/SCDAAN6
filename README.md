# Clustering Sales Data

**requirements**

our code is written in python3 and for ease of viewing has been placed in jupyter notebooks.

the following libraries are needed to run our code (as defined at the top of each notebook):

- numpy
- matplotlib
- pandas
- sklearn (not used for clustering)
- scipy
- itertools

The data we used has been placed in the daata folder allongside a link to the source and a discription of the columns.

**How To Run**

Our main presentation of our project occurs in the jupyter notebooks. These should be run using python3 (we used python3.12). The notebooks are numbered roughly chronologically with a number before their name.

We have also left all our old python3 files in the old_files folder (including old versions of our project plan). These are included for completenes and can still be run. They dont however contain a structured narative. These files should be run from the root folder (ie the one this README is in) using python3 old_files/filename.py
